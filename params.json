{"name":"agar.io Hack","tagline":"A tool to dominate agar.io without problems","body":"### Welcome to a tool created by OrbitronDev.\r\nUsing this tool, gives you the ability to hack agar.io easily. And the best part is, its FREE and OPEN SOURCE.\r\nTo start with it click `F12` on your keyboard and search for `Console` or similar things. Copy and Paste the code below and hit enter to start.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar agario_hack = document.createElement('script');\r\nagario_hack.async = true;\r\nagario_hack.type = 'text/javascript';\r\nagario_hack.src = '//d3strukt0rlp.github.io/agario-hack/agario-hack.js';\r\nvar node = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\r\nnode.parentNode.insertBefore(agario_hack, node);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Ignore the text below**\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this tool?
